# Sectors_Factors

Based on an MDOTMâ€™s research, made a few years ago, that investigated the differences in correlations of factors and sectors; I have redone this research on a Jupyter Notebook segmenting the observation into 3 timeframes: 
- 1 year before the COVID-19 pandemic (here there are some issues since the ETF's where quotd after on yfinance)
- From the pandemic to the beginning of the War in Ukraine 
- From the war in Ukraine to today
This research was made to update the results and gauge the differences in correlation of factors and sectors during all those complex and different periods.
 
To see the results of the analysis go to the [Juypter Notebook](sector_factors_corr.ipynb)

(Currently I'm trying to solve some issues with the data availability for the first timeframe)
