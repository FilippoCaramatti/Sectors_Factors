# Correlation: Sectors vs factors

This research looks at the correlations between each sector and each factor to verify which of the two is more relevant in portfolio diversification
The correlations are divided into 3 segments to see how it changes as time goes by 

- 1 year before the COVID-19 pandemic
- From the pandemic to the beginning of the War in Ukraine 
- From the war in Ukraine to today

 
To see the results of the analysis go to the [Juypter Notebook](sector_factors_corr.ipynb)

(Currently I'm trying to solve some issues with  data availability for the first segment)
