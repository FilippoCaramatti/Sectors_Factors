# Sectors_Factors

Based on an MDOTMâ€™s research that investigated the differences in correlation levels of factors and sectors a few years ago; I have redone this research on a Jupyter Notebook segmenting the observation into 3 timeframes: 1 year before the COVID-19 pandemic, from the pandemic to the beginning of the War in Ukraine and last from this event to today. This research was made to gauge the differences correlations level of sectors and factors during all those complex and different times.
