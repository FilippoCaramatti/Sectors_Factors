# Sectors_Factors

Based on an MDOTMâ€™s research, made a few years ago, that investigated the differences in correlation levels of factors and sectors; I have redone this research on a Jupyter Notebook segmenting the observation into 3 timeframes: 
- 1 year before the COVID-19 pandemic
- From the pandemic to the beginning of the War in Ukraine f
- From the war in ukraine to today
This research was made to gauge the differences in correlation of factors and sectors during all those complex and different times.
 
To see the results of my anaysis go to the [Juypter Notebook](Sectors_factors.ipynb)
